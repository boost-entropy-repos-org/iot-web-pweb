## ðŸ’» About the app

MyWebIOT is a web application for retrieving and watching data of IOT devices made with **Laravel** (PHP) and plain HTML, CSS and JS.

This project was made for the lab assignment for ProgramaciÃ³n Web in GITT (ULPGC)

## ðŸ’¡ Features

Any user can see the data received from the registered sensors and can register their own sensors for measuring temperature, humidity... For that, they need to be registered and logged in.

The data collected by the sensors will be sent periodically to the web server, which will be stored in a database, and can be viewed graphically on the website (using chart.js for plotting data).
