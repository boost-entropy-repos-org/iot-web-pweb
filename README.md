## 💻 About the app

MyWebIOT is a web application for retrieving and watching data of IOT devices made with **Laravel** (PHP) and **plain HTML, CSS and JS (and jQuery)**.

This project was made for the lab assignment for Programación Web in GITT (ULPGC)

## 💡 Features

Any user can see the data received from the registered sensors and can register their own sensors for measuring temperature, humidity... For that, they need to be registered and logged in.

The data collected is stored in a database, and can be viewed graphically on the website (using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for plotting data).
