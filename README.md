## ðŸ’» About the app

MyWebIOT is a web application for retrieving and watching data of IOT devices made with **Laravel**. This project was made for the lab assignment for ProgramaciÃ³n Web in GITT (ULPGC)

## ðŸ’¡ Features

Any user can see the data received from the registered sensors and can register at least their own sensors for measuring temperature, humidity... 

The data collected by the sensors will be sent periodically to the web server, which will be stored in a database, and can be viewed graphically on the website (using chart.js for plotting data).
